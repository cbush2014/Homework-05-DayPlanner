## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
* The current day is displayed at the top of the calendar 
* The application displays timeblocks for standard business hours (9 a.m. to 5 p.m.)  
* Each timeblock contains an input field and save button  
* Clicking a timeblock's "Save" button stores the input text in local storage, allowing the text to persist when the application is refreshed.
* Each timeblock is color coded to indicate whether it is in a past, present, or future hour.

To-do list:
* Update code to use Moment.js a 3rd party api
* Update localStorage processing to save under one entry
